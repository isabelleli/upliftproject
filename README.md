# upliftproject

Currently under development! The project is mostly functional. We are currently working with someone on the graphics design side of our project. View index.html file to run the code

- extended version of the hackathon project, smile-for-me
- a game in which the player is the main character faced with four different micro-aggressions
- after a NPC commits a micro-aggression, two options are provided as a response for the player
- each response generates a different fact and statistic about the situation
- used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery library to produce this game
